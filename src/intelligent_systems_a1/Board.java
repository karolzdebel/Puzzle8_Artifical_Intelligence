/*Board.java: It describes the state of 8-puzzle problem. It maintains the 8-puzzle board configuration, the
move that leads to this state, and the heuristic function value of the state relative to a goal. As Board as an
object whose configuration needs to be shown, it should be implemented as a subclass of ObjectPlus.
Board should include methods that test whether a state is the goal, test whether a move is legal, determine
the new state from a legal move, and determine the heuristic function value of a state./*
